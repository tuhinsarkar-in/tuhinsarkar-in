Figma Import Package for Tuhin Sarkar — Interactive Portfolio

Overview

This package contains a Figma-ready spec and assets to recreate a high-fidelity, interactive desktop mockup (1440px) for Tuhin Sarkar's portfolio. Since a native .fig file cannot be generated here, these artifacts provide everything a designer needs to quickly reproduce the Figma file.

Contents

- design-tokens.md — Color palette, typography, spacing, and animation tokens.
- figma-spec.md — Detailed frames specification, component list, and interaction map.
- assets/ — SVG placeholders for project screenshots, publications, and gallery items.
- README.md — This file.

How to use

1. Open Figma and create a new file.
2. Create frames at 1440x1024 (or 1440x900) for the desktop master.
3. Refer to `design-tokens.md` to set up Styles (Color Styles, Text Styles, Effects).
4. Copy/paste or import SVGs from `assets/` into frames.
5. Use `figma-spec.md` to create components, auto-layouts, and interaction prototypes (hover/click/scroll).

Notes

- Interaction prototypes are specified in `figma-spec.md` with suggested easing and durations.
- For advanced micro-interactions, install Figma plugins such as Smart Animate, Motion, and Starex for parallax guidance.
